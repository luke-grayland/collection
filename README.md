# Favourite Albums Collection App

This app allows users to keep track of their favourite albums. It is pre-populated with my personal favourites.

## Description

Album data is stored in a MySQL database, and displays the album name, artist name, year of release, cover art and a rating out of 10 (the number of stars shown reflects the rating). When clicked, each album links to the user to the respective album on Spotify.
